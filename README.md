# svc-taco

This repository aims to extract video frame data encoded using SVC. It builds on top of the
WebRTC [endtoend-encryption](https://github.com/webrtc/samples/tree/b938fa9552d21b8edb189d4922ddaaa9bb22128b/src/content/insertable-streams/endtoend-encryption)
sample.

## Status

Currently, the demo can log spatial and temporal layers for every encoded video frame. Codecs currently tested are VP9
and AV1.
